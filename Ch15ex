--15.1
{-The effect of export controls can be achieved using import controls. However export controls can can provide qualified names. This high level of controls is provided so that parts of the system that depend on each other can be developed and complied more indepentently. 

--15.2
{-It is the defalt that imported definitions are not themselves imported to prevent the accident editting of a definiation that another part of the system may depend on.-}

--15.3
{- Preventing a module from being exported of imported at all could be useful is the system if code was going known to be going to change. If this was the case it might prevent other modules from breaking when the code in the module breaks. 
This could be achieved in Haskell by having the module hide itself.-}
